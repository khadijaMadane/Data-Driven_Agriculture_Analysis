# Data Driven Agriculture Analysis

Welcome to the Agricultural Sector Analysis project! This project provides a comprehensive examination of Morocco's agricultural industry, using data from the *High Commission for Planning (HCP)* and other sources. Our goal is to identify trends, regional differences, and areas for improvement within Morocco's agriculture, covering key sectors like crop production, livestock, forestry, and fisheries.

## Project Overview
The analysis takes a multidimensional approach, integrating diverse agricultural data and economic indicators to assess the sector's performance at both national and regional levels. The insights gathered here can guide policy recommendations and support sustainable agricultural practices.

## Key Areas of Analysis
- *Land Use*: Examines the utilized agricultural area (UAA) and irrigated land distribution across Morocco.
- *Crop Production*: Analyzes cereal, legume, and oilseed production trends, identifying factors affecting yield and sustainability.
- *Livestock*: Evaluates livestock populations (cattle, sheep, goats) and meat production, focusing on regional variations and growth trends.
- *Forestry and Aquaculture*: Assesses forested areas and fishing activities, with an emphasis on sustainability and resource conservation.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes primarily from the *High Commission for Planning (HCP)*, along with additional datasets covering various agricultural indicators. Key features include:
- *Comprehensive Coverage*: Data from multiple regions and sectors, providing a holistic view of Moroccan agriculture.
- *Historical Trends*: Data spans multiple years, allowing for analysis of historical trends.
- *Regional Breakdown*: Enables comparison of different areas, identifying strengths and challenges across Morocco.

## Visualizations and Analysis
Data visualizations and statistical models help interpret findings across key sectors:
- *Plotly and Matplotlib*: Used for interactive charts and graphs, showing trends in land use, crop production, livestock numbers, and more.
- *Geospatial Analysis*: Maps and visualizations display regional differences in land use and productivity.
- *Time Series*: Highlights changes over time in crop yields, livestock counts, and resource usage.

## Results
The analysis reveals insights into Moroccoâ€™s agricultural productivity, including:
- *Yield Variability*: Shows yield variability across regions and crop types.
- *Resource Management*: Identifies regions with efficient resource use versus areas needing improvement.
- *Growth Trends*: Highlights regions showing strong growth or decline in agricultural productivity.
